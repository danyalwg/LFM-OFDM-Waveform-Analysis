# LFM + OFDM Waveform Generation and Analysis

Welcome to the **LFM + OFDM Waveform Generation and Analysis** repository. This project is a comprehensive PyQt5 application designed for generating, analyzing, and transmitting combined LFM (Linear Frequency Modulated) and OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) waveforms. It is built for both research and real-world testing scenarios and integrates with the ADALM-Pluto SDR for actual transmission. This README is extremely detailed to provide a complete understanding of the project for clients and end-users.

## Overview
The **LFM + OFDM Waveform Generation and Analysis** application provides an intuitive graphical interface that allows users to:
- **Generate LFM Waveforms:** Configure parameters such as start frequency, chirp rate, pulse width, and chirp direction (up or down).
- **Generate OFDM Waveforms:** Define the number of subcarriers, symbols per second, cyclic prefix percentage, and modulation scheme (BPSK, QPSK, or 16QAM).
- **Combine Waveforms:** Seamlessly merge an LFM prefix with OFDM data (after cyclic prefix removal) to create a joint waveform for improved synchronization and performance.
- **Analyze Performance:** Visualize time-domain plots, autocorrelation (range profile), 3D ambiguity functions (delay-Doppler analysis), and key performance indicators (KPIs) such as SNR, PSLR, data rate, BER, and detection probability.
- **Real-Time SDR Transmission:** Perform simulated transmissions (burst or continuous modes) and real-world transmission using ADALM-Pluto SDR.

This tool is ideal for researchers, engineers, and industry professionals working in radar systems, wireless communications, and signal processing.

## Installation

### Cloning the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal (or Command Prompt) and run:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LFM-OFDM-Waveform-Analysis.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd LFM-OFDM-Waveform-Analysis
```

### Installing Dependencies

```
pip3 install numpy matplotlib scipy PyQt5 qdarkstyle adi iio
```


### Pluto SDR Driver Installation
For the ADALM-Pluto SDR integration, you must install the appropriate drivers. Please follow the official instructions for Windows:

[Pluto SDR Drivers for Windows](https://wiki.analog.com/university/tools/pluto/drivers/windows)

Make sure to check system requirements and installation guidelines on the official page to ensure proper driver setup.

## Usage

### Launching the Application
After completing the installation, launch the application by executing:

```
python "joint_waveform_gui _v3.py"

## Troubleshooting and FAQ

### Common Issues
- **Invalid Parameter Inputs:**  
  - Double-check that all numerical inputs are entered in the correct format (e.g., decimal numbers for frequencies and time durations).
- **Data Reshaping Errors:**  
  - Ensure that the chosen number of subcarriers, symbols, and modulation scheme bits are consistent. Mismatches can cause errors during data reshaping for OFDM modulation.
- **Pluto SDR Not Detected:**  
  - Verify that your ADALM-Pluto SDR is properly connected, powered, and that the drivers are installed.
  - Check your systemâ€™s device manager for proper detection.
- **Application Freezing or Crashing:**  
  - Review error messages in the terminal; common issues are related to incorrect parameter values or driver problems.
